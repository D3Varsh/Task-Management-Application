b. Implement features such as comments, attachments, and task assignment for
effective collaboration.
7. Data Persistence:
a. Utilize MongoDB as the database to store task data.
b. Use Mongoose to define schemas and interact with the MongoDB database from
Node.js.
8. TypeScript Integration:
a. Utilize TypeScript for enhanced code maintainability, type checking, and better
developer experience.
b. Compile TypeScript code to JavaScript to run on the client-side and server-side.
9. Error Handling and Validation:
a. Implement client-side and server-side validation to ensure data integrity and
prevent errors.
b. Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to users.
10. RESTful API:
a. Design and implement a RESTful API using Express.js for handling CRUD operations
on tasks.
b. Use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with task data from the
client-side.
11. Responsive Design:
a. Ensure the application is accessible and functional across different devices and
screen sizes.
b. Utilize CSS media queries and responsive design principles to optimize the layout
and styling.
12. Deployment:
